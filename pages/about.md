# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** ,<br>

I am currently a fifth year Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering]{https://www.ccdc.ucsb.edu} at the [UC Santa Barbara]{https://www.ucsb.edu} working under [Dr. Jason R. Marden]{https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/~jrmarden/}. While I'm particularly interested in theoretical developments in algorithm design, I'm also excited at the budding opportunitites in robotics, automation, and especially bio(socio)-technical systems.
