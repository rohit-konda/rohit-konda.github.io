# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** ,<br>

I am currently a fifth year Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ccdc.ucsb.edu) at the [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu) working under [Dr. Jason R. Marden](https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/~jrmarden/). A list of my publications can be found at my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VAUUYtoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) page.

## Research Overview
My blanket research focus is on algorithm design for complex systems that have provable guarantees on system behavior. Respectively, my work uses tools from control theory, optimization, and game theory and has deep implications in robotics, automation, and heavy industry, as well bio- and socio-technical systems. Overall, the goal for my work is to borrow from rich theory and succesively use either data or domain knowledge to derive useful solutions for interesting applications.

# Collaborators
I've had the pleasure of working with many wonderful people. To a non-exhaustive list of people, I give my thanks.
