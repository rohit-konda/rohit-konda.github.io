### Theorem 1 (Pythagorean Theorem)
For a right-angled triangle with sides \( a \) and \( b \), and hypotenuse \( c \), the following holds:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

**Proof:**  
Consider a right triangle with legs \( a \) and \( b \) and hypotenuse \( c \). By constructing two identical triangles and rearranging them into a square, we derive:

$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
$

Thus, the theorem is proven $\square$.
