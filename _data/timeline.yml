- title: Algorithm Engineer at BlackVe
  from: 2024
  to: Present
  description: Responsibilities include developing and testing control/estimation algorithms for satellite autonomy. At BlackVe, I was commited to building on-board autonomy capable of lights out operations.

- title: Ph. D. at UC Santa Barbara
  from: 2019
  to: 2024
  description: Under the advisement of Dr. Jason Marden, I studied multi-agent systems through game-theoretic and optimization tools. I worked on two main projects in my PhD - analyzing behavior of best-response processes in multi-agent systems and deriving optimizing scheduling algorithms for industrial refrigeration. 

- title: M.S. at Georgia Institute of Techonology
  from: 2018
  to: 2019
  description: Under the advisement of Dr. Sam Coogan and Dr. Magnus Egerstedt, I studied correct-by-construction methods in nonlinear control using control barrier functions. I focused on both theoretical developments and as exploring potential applications to autonomous driving.
  
  

- title: B.S. at Georgia Institute of Techonology
  from: 2015
  to: 2018
  description: Under the advisement of Dr. Rob Butera and Dr. Vineet Tiruvadi, I studied dynamical methods for neuroscience. I engaged in experimental research with mice models and studied Kuramoto dynamical models for synchronization.
