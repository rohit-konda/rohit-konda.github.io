  description: Under the advisement of Jason Marden, my research focus has been on game theory and optimization. In my PhD, I have worked on two main projects. One project is analysis of best response behavior in multi-agent systems in different settings. The other project deals with optimizing the scheduling algorithms for heavy industrial refrigeration in cooperation with CrossnoKaye.

  description: I received a M.S in Electrical and Computer Engineering, where my focus was on control systems and signal processing under the advisement of Dr. Sam Coogan and Dr. Magnus Egerstedt. My work focused on correct-by-construction methods in nonlinear control using control barrier functions with applications in autonomous driving.
